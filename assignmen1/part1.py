#I started by inspecting the IC2S2 2023 program page in a browser to determine where participant names are located;
# they typically appear within list items. Using BeautifulSoupâ€™s find_all method,
# I extracted all <li> tags and applied a regular expression to capture names that follow the "First Last" format,
# ensuring at least two words with capitalized initials.
# I then cleaned the extracted strings to remove extra punctuation and whitespace.
# To avoid duplicates caused by minor spelling variations, I stored the names in a set.
# Finally, I saved the unique names to a text file. Manual verification and iterative regex adjustments
# were used to ensure that the names are both complete and accurate.
# In my test, I obtained approximately 125 unique researchers.
